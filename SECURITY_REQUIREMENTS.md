# **Security Requirements and Expectations**

This document outlines the **security requirements** for the `gh-bofh-rs` project, as well as what users can and cannot expect in terms of security from the software.

---

## **What Users Can Expect**

1. **No Sensitive Data Handling**:
   - The `gh-bofh-rs` software does not handle, process, or store any sensitive or personal data. It is a simple command-line tool that generates random BOFH excuses.
   - Users can expect that the software does not pose a risk to their data privacy.

2. **No Network Communication**:
   - The software does not communicate over the network. All operations are performed locally on the user's machine.
   - Users can expect that the software does not introduce network-related security risks.

3. **Transparent Source Code**:
   - The source code is open and available for review on GitHub. Users can inspect the code to verify its functionality and security.
   - Users can expect transparency in how the software operates.

4. **Minimal Dependencies**:
   - The software has minimal dependencies (`clap` for CLI argument parsing and `rand` for random number generation). These dependencies are widely used and well-maintained.
   - Users can expect that the software does not introduce unnecessary security risks through third-party libraries.

---

## **What Users Cannot Expect**

1. **No Security Guarantees**:
   - While the software is designed to be simple and secure, it is provided **as-is** without any explicit security guarantees.
   - Users should not expect the software to be free from vulnerabilities or bugs.

2. **No Protection Against Malicious Use**:
   - The software does not include mechanisms to prevent misuse or malicious use. For example, it does not validate or sanitize input beyond basic CLI argument parsing.
   - Users should not expect the software to protect against intentional misuse.

3. **No Long-Term Support for Security Issues**:
   - While security issues will be addressed on a best-effort basis, there is no formal long-term support (LTS) commitment for the software.
   - Users should not expect ongoing security updates or patches beyond the maintainer's availability.

---

## **Security Requirements**

The `gh-bofh-rs` software is intended to meet the following security requirements:

1. **No Data Collection**:
   - The software must not collect, store, or transmit any user data.

2. **Local Execution Only**:
   - The software must operate entirely locally on the user's machine, with no network communication.

3. **Minimal Attack Surface**:
   - The software must minimize its attack surface by using only essential dependencies and avoiding unnecessary complexity.

4. **Transparency**:
   - The software must provide full transparency into its functionality through open-source code and clear documentation.

---

## **Security Justification**

The security requirements are justified based on the following principles:

1. **Simplicity**:
   - The software is designed to be simple and lightweight, reducing the likelihood of security vulnerabilities.

2. **Limited Scope**:
   - The software's scope is limited to generating random excuses, which does not involve sensitive operations or data.

3. **Open Source**:
   - The open-source nature of the software allows for community review and contributions, which helps identify and address potential security issues.

4. **Minimal Dependencies**:
   - By relying on well-established and widely-used libraries (`clap` and `rand`), the software reduces the risk of introducing vulnerabilities through third-party code.
