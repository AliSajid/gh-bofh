# Project Roadmap

## Overview

This project is currently functionally stable, and no new functionality is planned. Our primary focus will be on maintaining the existing features and expanding the list of Bastard Operator From Hell (BOFH) style excuses.

## Planned Updates

- **Excuse List Expansion**: We're going to add more BOFH-style excuses to keep your users bewildered and your sanity intact.

## Maintenance

- **Bug Fixes**: Squashing bugs like the ruthless operator you are.
- **Performance Improvements**: Making sure the extension runs smoother than your best excuse.

## Community Involvement

- **Feedback and Suggestions**: Got a killer excuse? Share it with us, and it might just make the list.

Thank you for your continued support, and remember: it's always the user's fault!
