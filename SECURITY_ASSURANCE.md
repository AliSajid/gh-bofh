# **Assurance Case for gh-bofh**

This document provides an assurance case for the `gh-bofh` project, justifying why its security requirements are met. The assurance case includes a description of the threat model, identification of trust boundaries, an argument that secure design principles have been applied, and an argument that common implementation security weaknesses have been countered.

---

## **1. Threat Model**

### **Description of Threats**

The `gh-bofh` project is a simple command-line tool that generates random BOFH excuses. Given its limited scope and functionality, the threat model is relatively simple. The primary threats include:

1. **Unauthorized Access**:
   - Threat: An attacker could attempt to modify the software or its dependencies to introduce malicious behavior.
   - Mitigation: The software is distributed as open-source code, allowing users to inspect and verify its integrity. Dependencies are minimized and well-vetted.

2. **Data Privacy Risks**:
   - Threat: The software could inadvertently collect or expose sensitive user data.
   - Mitigation: The software does not collect, store, or transmit any user data. All operations are performed locally on the user's machine.

3. **Code Injection**:
   - Threat: An attacker could attempt to inject malicious code into the software or its dependencies.
   - Mitigation: The software uses minimal dependencies (`clap` and `rand`), which are widely used and well-maintained. Input validation is performed by the `clap` library.

### **Threats out of scope**

The following threats are out of scope for this project, based on its architecture and intended usage:

- Network-based attacks (no network I/O occurs during normal operation).
- Data exfiltration or leakage via application behavior (no data is collected or stored).
- Filesystem tampering through normal app operation (no files are read or written).
- Physical access or OS-level compromise of the host.
- Supply-chain attacks beyond dependency management and auditing practices.

---

## **2. Trust Boundaries**

### **Identification of Trust Boundaries**

The trust boundaries for the `gh-bofh` project are as follows:

1. **User Input**:
   - The command-line arguments provided by the user and the optional environment variable `EXCUSE_TYPE` (mirrors `--type`) are parsed by the `clap` library. This is the primary trust boundary, as these inputs are the only external data the software processes.

2. **Dependencies**:
   - The software relies on two external libraries (`clap` and `rand`). These libraries are trusted components, but their integrity is ensured by using verified versions from the Rust ecosystem.

3. **Local Execution**:
   - The software operates entirely locally on the user's machine. There is no network or filesystem I/O as part of normal operation, which eliminates many potential trust boundaries.

---

## **3. Secure Design Principles**

### **Argument for Secure Design Principles**

The `gh-bofh` project adheres to the following secure design principles:

1. **Minimal Attack Surface**:
   - The software has a minimal attack surface due to its limited functionality and lack of network or filesystem I/O. This reduces the potential for security vulnerabilities.

2. **Least Privilege**:
   - The software does not require elevated privileges to run. It operates with the same permissions as the user running the command.

3. **Transparency**:
   - The software is open-source, allowing users to inspect the code and verify its security. This transparency helps build trust and enables community review.

4. **Defense in Depth**:
   - Although the software is simple, it uses well-established libraries (`clap` and `rand`) that follow secure coding practices. This provides an additional layer of security.
5. **Implementation Constraints**:
   - The project enforces MSRV 1.85.1, forbids `unsafe_code`, and applies strict rustdoc lints. These constraints reduce the risk of introducing unsafe patterns and keep examples verifiable in CI.

---

## **4. Countering Common Implementation Security Weaknesses**

### **Argument for Countering Common Weaknesses**

The `gh-bofh` project addresses common implementation security weaknesses as follows:

1. **Input Validation**:
   - The `clap` library is used to parse and validate command-line arguments, preventing injection attacks or malformed input.

2. **Memory Safety**:
   - The software is written in Rust, a memory-safe language that prevents common vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows and use-after-free errors.

3. **Dependency Management**:
   - The software uses minimal dependencies, and these dependencies are regularly updated to their latest secure versions using tools like `cargo-audit`.

4. **No Sensitive Data Handling**:
   - The software does not handle sensitive data, eliminating risks related to data breaches or leaks.

5. **Local Execution**:
   - The software operates entirely locally with no network or filesystem I/O, reducing the risk of network-based attacks such as man-in-the-middle (MITM) or remote code execution and avoiding file permission concerns.

---

## **5. Conclusion**

The `gh-bofh` project meets its security requirements by adhering to secure design principles, minimizing its attack surface, and countering common implementation security weaknesses. The threat model is simple due to the software's limited scope, and trust boundaries are clearly defined. The use of memory-safe languages, minimal dependencies, and open-source transparency further strengthens the security of the project.


## **6. Evidence**

The following artifacts and repository configuration provide concrete evidence supporting the assurance claims above. All references below point to files and workflows present in the project repository.

Related documents:

- `SECURITY.md` — reporting and disclosure process.
- `SECURITY_REQUIREMENTS.md` — security requirements and expectations.

- Continuous Integration: `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` — the CI workflow builds and tests the project across multiple Rust toolchains and platforms, runs formatting and lint checks, and gates releases on successful CI.
- Toolchain and policy: `Cargo.toml` — lists the project Rust MSRV (`rust-version = "1.85.1"`), dependencies (`clap`, `rand`), and lint rules (forbid `unsafe_code`, deny certain rustdoc errors) which demonstrate intentional safety posture.
- Dependency lockfile: `Cargo.lock` — records exact dependency versions used during builds, enabling reproducible builds and audits.
- Tests: `tests/` and crate unit tests — exercise the CLI parsing and core library behavior and are executed by CI (`cargo test`).
- Release and badge automation: the CI workflow includes steps to publish dynamic build badges and drive the release workflow only when CI passes, reducing the chance of publishing untested code.

Where applicable, maintainers run `cargo audit` and similar tools locally or in CI to detect known vulnerable dependency versions and respond accordingly.

## **7. Verification checklist**

The following checklist captures the verification activities that should be performed regularly to maintain the assurance case. Each item maps to repository artefacts or CI actions listed in the Evidence section.

Automated checks (run in CI on every push/PR):

1. Build: `cargo build` on the configured toolchains and platforms (see `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`).
2. Test: `cargo test` to validate behavior and guard against regressions.
3. Format: `cargo fmt -- --check` to enforce consistent formatting.
4. Lint: `cargo clippy` with `-D warnings` to enforce code quality and catch suspicious patterns.
5. Dependency audit: run `cargo audit` (manually or via CI) against `Cargo.lock` and ensure no high/critical advisories are present.

Manual or periodic checks:

1. Review `Cargo.lock` changes in PRs to detect unintended dependency bumps.
2. Perform a code review focusing on security-sensitive changes (argument parsing, external inputs, build scripts).
3. Validate the release artifact contents (ensure `gh-bofh` binary is present and executable in release archives distributed via GitHub Releases).
4. Respond to reported vulnerabilities following the project's `SECURITY.md` policy (acknowledge within 48 hours and publish a fix timeline).

Optional verification activities (as needed):

- Run a local `cargo audit` and generate a report for inclusion in release notes when addressing dependency vulnerabilities.
- Perform a manual dependency provenance check for third-party crates if a dependency has an active advisory.

Maintainers should record verification outcomes in issue trackers or release notes as appropriate to provide an audit trail for the assurance case.

## **Appendix — Evidence excerpts & verification commands**

The snippets below are direct, representative excerpts from repository artefacts called out in the Evidence section. They are included to make it easy to locate the exact configuration used by the project.

Cargo.toml (toolchain and policy excerpts):

```toml
[package]
rust-version = "1.85.1"

[dependencies]
clap = { version = "4.5.4", features = ["env", "derive"] }
rand = { version = "0.9.0" }

[lints.rust]
unsafe_code = "forbid"
```

CI workflow (representative job / step names present in `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`):

- check_changed_dirs
- ci (matrix build)
  - Cargo Build
  - Cargo Test
  - Cargo Format
  - Cargo Lint

Dependency lockfile:

- `Cargo.lock` is present in the repository and records the exact pinned dependency versions used during builds and audits.

Explicit verification commands (these are the commands referenced in the Verification checklist and are reproducible locally):

```bash
# build
cargo build --verbose

# run tests
cargo test

# format check
cargo +nightly fmt --all -- --check

# lint (clippy)
cargo clippy -- -D warnings

# dependency audit (requires cargo-audit to be installed)
cargo audit --file Cargo.lock
```

Include the output or a short summary in the related issue or PR when addressing a finding so reviewers can confirm the verification step was completed.

Cargo-audit guidance


The project uses `cargo-audit` as the primary tool to detect known vulnerable dependency versions. The guidance below covers installation, running the audit, interpreting results, and recommended actions when an advisory is reported.

Installation

```bash
# install cargo-audit (requires Rust and cargo)
cargo install cargo-audit
```

Run an audit

```bash
# basic audit using the repository lockfile
cargo audit --file Cargo.lock

# produce a JSON report for automation
cargo audit --file Cargo.lock --json > cargo-audit-report.json
```

Interpreting results

- `cargo-audit` checks `Cargo.lock` against the RustSec advisory database and reports advisories with severity and CVE references (when available).
- A typical report lists the vulnerable crate, advisory ID, version ranges affected, and suggested remediation (upgrade to a fixed version or apply a patch).

Recommended actions on findings

1. If an advisory indicates a direct dependency is vulnerable, update the `Cargo.toml` to a safe version and run `cargo update -p <crate>` to update `Cargo.lock`. Open a PR with the change and include the audit report.
2. If the issue is in a transitive dependency, prefer to update the dependent direct crate to a version that pulls a safe transitive version. If no fix is available, consider raising an issue with the upstream project or applying a temporary patch (with caution).
3. For high/critical advisories treat remediation as urgent; include the audit report in the issue and reference the advisory IDs.

Recording and communicating results

- Attach the `cargo-audit` output (text or JSON) to the related issue or PR so reviewers can confirm the finding and remediation.
- For automated workflows, include the JSON report in CI artifacts when available and link it from the release notes or security issue.

Notes

- `cargo-audit` relies on the RustSec advisory database; it does not detect zero-day or unpublished vulnerabilities. Use it regularly as part of dependency hygiene.
- Consider running `cargo-audit` locally before creating dependency changes and include the report as part of the PR description.
